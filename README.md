# Shopping Cart- Backend

This project primarily focuses on demonstrating basic object-oriented programming concepts and data structures in the context of a simple shopping cart program. It doesn't delve into more advanced features like inheritance, polymorphism, or exception handling, which are often covered in a more comprehensive introduction to OOP.


## Usage

The program provides an interactive command-line interface (CLI) for managing the shopping cart. Here are the available actions:

• Add Item (a): Allows you to add items to the cart. You will be prompted to choose a product from the list of available products.

• View Cart (v): Displays the contents of the cart along with the total amount.

• Checkout (c): Initiates the checkout process. You will be prompted to enter the amount paid in cash, and the program will calculate the change if applicable.


## Code Structure

The code is organized into three classes:

• Product: Represents a product with an ID, name, and price.

• Item: Represents an item in the shopping cart, consisting of a product and its quantity.

• Cart: Represents a shopping cart that can add products, calculate the total price, view the cart contents, and check out.
